# QuickPrompts

QuickPrompts is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to select code or text and run it through a set of AI-powered quick prompts, returning the results directly in your editor. The extension streamlines your workflow by providing a variety of helpful prompts for code fixes, formatting, conversions, and more.

## Features

QuickPrompts offers a wide range of static prompts that serve as aliases for detailed instructions. These prompts help reduce verbosity and make it easier to apply common tasks to your code or text selections. Some of the available prompts include grammar and syntax fixes, formatting options (such as tables, bullets, or comments), text generation (explanations, summaries, shell scripts), file conversions (to JSON, Markdown, Python, CSV, YAML), code checking, translations, and code generation utilities. The extension is especially useful for quickly editing, formatting, or analyzing code and text without leaving your editor.

## Requirements

To use QuickPrompts, you need Visual Studio Code version 1.70.0 or higher. There are no additional dependencies required for basic usage. If you wish to use AI-powered features, ensure you have an internet connection and any necessary API keys configured as required by your setup.

## Extension Settings

If your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point, document them here. For example:

- `quickprompts.enable`: Enable or disable the extension.
- `quickprompts.apiKey`: Set your API key for AI-powered features.

## Known Issues
